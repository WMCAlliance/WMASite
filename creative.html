Creative is the original game style that was provided back in Minecraft Classic. It allows you to build without having to worry about resource counts or getting attacked by mob.
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
Firstly, begin by grabbing yourself a plot using the command listed below. These plots are 100x100, and the ground is fairly high up, so you should have enough space above and below to build whatever you like. Within this area, you can build anything you like, from small redstone contraptions to giant towers and crazy statues, all by using the infinite Creative inventory.
