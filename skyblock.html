SkyBlock is one of those game modes where you have to try it to understand it. Basically, you start on a tiny island in the sky, and your goal is to simply survive and expand. You are provided with some very important basics to get you started, but it's up to you how you do it. To begin your adventure, use the portals at Spawn. To exit, the command is <strong>/is spawn</strong>. This game is best played individually, but if you want to play with friends, this can be done in Party Mode. To start a party, simply use <strong>/is invite player</strong> to invite a friend. To kick them out of the party, use <strong>/is kick player</strong>, or to exit a party yourself use <strong>/is leave</strong>.
