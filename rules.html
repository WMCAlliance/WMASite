<h5>Rules &amp; Guidelines</h5>
<strong>Note:</strong> These rules are differently written than the book you recieve in-game. The rules in that book are simplified so they fit within such a poor medium. The rules you see below are as accurate as we can make them.
<h4>General Gameplay</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Respect both staff and other players. <!-- General expansion required --></li>
	<li>Griefing and stealing are strictly disallowed. <!-- Needs expanding --></li>
	<li>PvP (player vs player battle) is not allowed at the current time. This includes setting players on fire or breaking blocks below them.</li>
	<li>If you are silly enough to join a player's <strong>town</strong>, that is no excuse to ignore protecting your own home. If someone griefs you within a town, that is solely for you to discuss with the town owner. However, keep in mind, that the Server Owner's rules <strong>always</strong> overrule that of a player, even if that player owns a town you live in. Personally, we are against towns, but we're not stopping players from creating or joining them.</li>
	<li>Hacks, game modifications (mods), or texture packs that provide advantages are never allowed. <!-- Needs extended detail - mention disallowing XRay, auto-aim, but mention allowing minimaps, inventory managers --></li>
	<li>Staff positions (for us, op = admin) are not given out freely. Asking (or spamming) staff to give you such a rank will earn either a mute or a ban – sometimes permanent. <!-- Needs expansion, include link to staff applications forum - also side reminder, staff applications page needs improving; make a proper form for submissions, possibly a check for previous bans etc)--></li>
	<li>Dirty or offensive skins are not allowed <!-- Explain consequences behind this - longer bans than normal as this can be changed too easily --></li>
	<li>Players under 13 are able to be kicked or banned at our discretion. In other words, if you’re under 13, we are allowed to kick/ban you even if you don’t agree with the reasoning behind it. <!-- Needs detail - explain WHY, we're not just being cruel or unfair - we have real reasons behind this --></li>
	<li>Players are not allowed to order staff (or, any other players) around. The people who run this server do so by following their own rules and keeping the server clean and fair – not to your individual benefit</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chat/Communications</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Advertising of other Minecraft servers (or similar) is prohibited. You’re playing on WMA, not somewhere else.</li>
	<li>Spamming is not tolerated. This could mean a number of things; don’t repeat yourself, don’t repeatedly ask for things, don’t send multiple /trade or /tpr requests, when correcting yourself only correct one word instead of repeating the entire sentence, etc. <!-- Needs improving - maybe add a sub-list of some sort --></li>
	<li>We do not condone (allow) swearing. Due to majority of our players being underage, we would rather not expose them to vulgarity. That said, some basic words are ok. This includes, but may not be limited to, ‘crap’ and ‘shit’. However, such usage should be limited – use it once, on occasion, if you must. But don’t make a habit of it.<!-- Needs expanding, what words are clearly not allowed --></li>
	<li>Anything not allowed in regular chat is also not allowed in private messaging (also known as /msg, /tell or /whisper).</li>
	<li>Due to excessive misuse (overuse), any usage of the word ‘budder’ is now a 1 hour ban. Incorrect usage of the word ‘butter’ will be a 30 minute ban. Furthermore, attempting to circumvent or make fun of this rule will be a 2 hour ban. This rule cannot be disputed, and has only been created due to player misuse, not because we ‘want’ such a rule.</li>
	<li>You are not allowed to use MineChat. Not only could you get killed and not be able to retrieve your stuff, it also wastes server resources. We have IRC on the web and through apps if you want to chat.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Accounts</h4>
<ol>
	<li>We do not condone/allow account sharing – keep your account safe and secure, don’t allow others to use it</li>
	<li>As we say, we ban the account not the player – if a friend used your account and got banned, it’s your fault for not keeping it secure</li>
	<li>If you ask for a friend’s account to be unbanned – we are allowed to ban you. We only ban people when we have valid reason to, and if you disagree with a ban of ours then clearly you don’t understand our rules</li>
</ol>
<h4>Expectations</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If you notice a glitch that affects gameplay (or that causes cheating) then notify a staff member (either in chat or on the forums) as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>If you cause accidental grief to another player, apologise and fix the issue immediately. If you cannot fix it yourself, contact an admin.</li>
	<li>All players are expected to check back on this webpage for changes. Failure to do so could result in a ban you did not expect, and no sympathy.</li>
	<li>When making your website/forum account, you must use the same username as your Minecraft name. You can then change your display name on your profile.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributors</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Not every donator will get this rank. As much as we appreciate the donation, we simply won’t give extra permissions to those we don’t trust.</li>
	<li>You are not exempt from any rules specified above. If you do break any of them, you will be temporarily banned and your donator rank may be revoked, permanently.</li>
	<li>If you choose to set a nickname for yourself, remember that we have the right to tell you that it’s inappropriate and that we can change it back if you don’t. This includes custom rank prefixes.</li>
	<li>If you notice an issue with permissions (for example, a setting you change in Creative affects you in Survival) you must notify a staff member as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
