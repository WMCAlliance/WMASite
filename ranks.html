<h3>Player</h3>
<p>Most likely, this is your current rank. Most importantly, it's unlikely you will go up to a different rank. It is important to remember not to ask for other ranks.</p>

<h3>Demoted</h3>
<p>Players with this rank have recently been demoted, banned, and have returned after their ban is complete. They have to re-do the introductory quiz/puzzle.</p>

<h3>Newbie</h3>
<p>Players only have this rank the first time they connect. It simply shows that they know literally nothing about the server. Once they've read the rules, they are pushed up to the Player rank.</p>
