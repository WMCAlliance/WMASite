Survival is the "default" game style available in Minecraft. For Survival, we feel that a Vanilla experience is the best experience, so we only provide minimal features to protect yourself and your items, as well as an easy-to-use home and warp system.
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
Majority of Survival is the way you'd expect. You collect resources, slay mobs, build a house, collect more resources. However, as long as you correctly protect your area, you won't have to worry about griefers, hackers and rule-breakers, as we provide very customizable region, animal and chest protection.
